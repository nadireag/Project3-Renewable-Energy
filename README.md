### Questions:

* Which states are using the most renewable energy?

* Total energy consumption vs. renewable energy potential by State: Can a Stateâ€™s potential meet their consumption?

* Types of renewable energy by highest potential: Which types account for the most potential? By State?

## Analysis

* Clean and modify the data using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook.

* Use Heroku and PostgreSQL as the database.

* Use Python as the server side language, Flask as the web server and SQLAlchemy as the ORM.

* Use HTML, CSS and JavaScript on the front end.

* Use D3, Plotly, Chart.js and Leaflet to visualize the data.
